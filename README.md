# haLOLween!

A little app that delivers halloween jokes on demand.

Made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)

## About the project
This is just my entry point to Svelte. I decided to develop something small thus allowing me to release it fast, yet covering all the essentials of the framework, such as conditional rendering and the svelte/store.

## Live app:
